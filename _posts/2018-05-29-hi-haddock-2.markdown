title:  "Hi Haddock 2: The Lexer prototype is ready for review"
---

Progress has been better than expected in the past two weeks, so I've just
submitted my Lexer prototype including serialization for review on [Phabricator][phab].

Some of this work has been great fun. Changing the documentation types and then
following the type errors for hours was straight up addicting.

I was also amazed when I copied the code for extracting docstrings from declarations
from haddock and was mostly done after fixing a few type errors. Both my mentors and I
had expected this to be way more work than it turned out to be.

Planned next is a prototype of the `:doc` command in GHCi.
